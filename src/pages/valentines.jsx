            <br />
            <br />
            i know i haven't known you for much longer than a year, but it truly
            feels like i've known you since i was a little dumb kid. every time
            i'm done with class or work and we talk right after, i feel safe
            with you, like i'm coming home. as soon as i'm out of class, i get
            so excited to talk to you. anytime something happens in my life or
            even as i'm just walking down the street, i feel like i cannot wait
            to tell you. some crazy and exciting subway story doesn't feel as
            crazy and exciting until i tell you about it. i love listening to
            you tell me about everything you've been throughâ€”all your out of
            nowhere career switches, your random drops of tea every now and
            then. i want to hear all of you. you've made me feel more heard than
            i have in a while, and i love you for that.
            <br />
            <br />
            every so often, i think about how it felt to hold you, like the last
            time we spent the day at my apartment. i genuinely cannot wait to
            hug you and kiss the actual fuck out of you when i see you again. i
            miss seeing how beautiful you are right in front of me. i think all
            the time about how pretty your eyes looked when they were looking at
            me. i can't wait to remind you how badly i want to be with you
            again.
            <br />
            <br />
            you're the most confident person i know. i always admire the way you
            carry yourself. i hope that if i'm around you way more in the
            future, some of your confidence will start to seep into me as well.
            you're so special, pooja, never forget that, and i really hope this
            was as funny and unpredictable as you are lol.
            <br />
            <br />
            happy valentine's day
